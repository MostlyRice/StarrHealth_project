# Project Starr Health Co.

Starr Health Scheduling Web App is a full-stack web application with the purpose of helping Students connect with Starr Health Coaches who match their needs and connect with those Coaches. The application will include registration for Students, an algorithm that will match Students with Coaches, allow Students to connect with those Coaches and schedule meetings with Coaches to get the help they need.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. You can either fork this repoistory and then clone it from your computer or you can download the zip file.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  - The database name will have to be called "StarrHealth".
  - Please see the database.sql file, it will give you the queries you need to create the database tables. If you select all the tables at once, you should be able to execute all of them at once.
  - Please see the database_data.sql file once the database tables are created. If you select all of the inserts at once, you should be able to execute all of them at once.
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)
  - We recommend this PostgreSQL GUI client as it was the one we used.
- [Filestack](https://www.filestack.com/)
  - You will need to have a Filestack account and a Filestack API Key. We use Filestack for uploading documents and photos. The server will not function if you *do not* have your Filestack API Key in the code. Please see Installing documentation.
- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
  - You will need to have a Twilio account and a Twilio API Key. We use Twilio for messaging between coaches and students. The server will not function if you *do not* have your Twilio API Key in the code. Please see Installing documentation.

### Installing

- Once you clone the repo, you will want to run `npm i` to install all the modules so that the repo should function properly.

- The database utilizes user roles.
  * User Role 1: Student (These users register as normal)
  * User Role 2: Coach (They are created via Admin and Super Admin features)
  * User Role 3: Admin (Only has access Admin features)
  * User Role 4: Super Admin (This is an Admin that is also a Coach)

  - To create your first Admin, you'll need to register as a new student registering for the application for the first time. Once you are on the disclaimer page, you can go back to the home page. There is no need to continue with registration.

  - Once on the home page, you will want to use PostgreSQL or PostgreSQL GUI client of your choice to change your new registered users' `user_role` number to 3 (for Admin).

  - To create a Super Admin, which serves as an Admin and a Coach, you will need to create a Coach via the Admin features and then you will want to use PostgreSQL or PostgreSQL GUI client of your choice to change your new registered users' `user_role` number to 4 (for Super Admin).

- To utilize Filestack, you will need to open file `StarrHealth_project/server/public/scripts/services/coach.service.js` and add the Filestack API Key for your account on line 44 `self.client = filestack.init("");` inserting the API Key between the `""`.

- To utilize Twilio, you will need to open file `StarrHealth_project/server/routes/sms.router.js` and add the Twilio accountSid API key for the account on line 8 `const accountSid = '';` inserting the API Key between the `''` as well as add the Twilio authToken API key for the account on line 9 `const authToken = '';` inserting the API key between the `''`.

- Then it will be as simple as typing `npm start` to start up the application and you can access it on your browser at `http://localhost:5000/`
